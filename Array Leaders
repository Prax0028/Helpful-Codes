#Given an array arr of n positive integers, your task is to find all the leaders in the array. 
#An element of the array is considered a leader if it is greater than all the elements on its right side or if it is equal to the maximum element on its right side. 
#The rightmost element is always a leader.

#Input: n = 5, arr[] = {10,4,2,4,1}
#Output: 10 4 4 1
#Explanation: Note that both of the 4s are in output, as to be a leader an equal element is also allowed on the right. side

def leaders(self,n, arr):
        leaders = []
        maxEle = arr[n-1]
        i = n-1
        while i>=0:
            k = arr[i] 
            if k>=maxEle:
                leaders.append(k)
                maxEle = k
            i -= 1
        leaders.sort(reverse = True)
        return leaders
